# **Rock-Paper-Scissors game**

This is a modified and improved version of a wordly famous Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Initial concept formed by loosely following a You-Tube video tutorial:   
**[Web Development Tutorial - JavaScript, HTML, CSS - Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) ( _featured on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) and created by [Whatsdev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0tRdbXVDbhaRvZPKsRgmxg)_ ).**

## **Idea and inspiration**

From the very start, I did not have the intention for this to become a personal project, since the game itself is pretty basic.
<br>
I have started making it by vaguely following the above mentioned tutorial for the purpose of learning how some vanilla Java Script concepts work in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

## **Initial features**

Play a game agains a computer. There is no aditional options nor the time limit, so it can be played as long as desired.

Existing features implemented were:
- Choice panel with available choices ( _rock, paper or scissors_ ). On each move image that represents Your choice and image that represents computers choice are being highlighted with 1 of the 3 possible colors, depending on the result:
    - **Green** - victory
    - **Gray** - draw
    - **Red** - loss
- Score board
- Result message that changes based on a result

## **Newly added features**

Additional styling, logic, elements and functionality added by myself are as following:
